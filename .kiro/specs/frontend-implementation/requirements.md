# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive React-based frontend for the Intelligent Code Review Bot with Pattern Learning system. The frontend will provide a modern, intuitive interface for developers to interact with the AI-powered code review system, including authentication, code submission, review management, and pattern learning features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Authentication System

6. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL maintain their session across page refreshes

### Requirement 2: Home Page and Landing Experience

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see an engaging home page that explains the platform's capabilities, so that I can understand the value proposition and get started quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the home page THEN the system SHALL display a hero section with clear value proposition
2. WHEN a user scrolls through the home page THEN the system SHALL show key features of the code review bot
3. WHEN a user reaches the bottom of the home page THEN the system SHALL display a footer with relevant links and information
4. WHEN a user clicks on call-to-action buttons THEN the system SHALL navigate them to appropriate sections
5. IF a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL show login/signup options prominently

### Requirement 3: Code Review Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want multiple ways to submit code for review including direct editing, file upload, and GitHub integration, so that I can use the method most convenient for my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user selects the Monaco Editor tab THEN the system SHALL provide a code editor with syntax highlighting
3. WHEN a user selects the File Upload tab THEN the system SHALL allow uploading code files with drag-and-drop functionality
4. WHEN a user selects the GitHub Integration tab THEN the system SHALL provide options to connect and select repositories
5. WHEN a user submits code for review THEN the system SHALL process it and display review results
6. WHEN a review is complete THEN the system SHALL show structured feedback with severity levels and suggestions

### Requirement 4: Review History and Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view my past code reviews and track my improvement over time, so that I can learn from previous feedback and monitor my coding progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the past reviews page THEN the system SHALL display a chronological list of their previous reviews
2. WHEN a user clicks on a past review THEN the system SHALL show detailed review results and feedback
3. WHEN a user views past reviews THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options by date, language, or severity
4. WHEN a user has multiple reviews THEN the system SHALL implement pagination for better performance
5. IF a user has no past reviews THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state with guidance

### Requirement 5: Pattern Learning Dashboard

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see how the AI has learned from my coding patterns and preferences, so that I can understand how the system adapts to provide more personalized reviews.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the pattern learning page THEN the system SHALL display their coding patterns and preferences
2. WHEN the system has learned patterns THEN it SHALL show visual representations of common issues and improvements
3. WHEN a user views pattern learning data THEN the system SHALL display statistics on review acceptance rates and learning effectiveness
4. WHEN patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL show how these influence future review suggestions
5. IF insufficient data exists THEN the system SHALL explain how pattern learning works and encourage more reviews

### Requirement 6: User Profile Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my profile information and account settings, so that I can keep my information current and customize my experience.
