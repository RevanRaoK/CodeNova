# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on connecting the existing React frontend to the FastAPI backend with proper API integration, implementing Monaco editor for enhanced code editing experience, and establishing robust routing and state management. The goal is to create a seamless user experience where users can submit code for review through a professional code editor and receive real-time feedback from the AI-powered backend analysis service.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use a professional Monaco code editor to write and edit code for review, so that I have syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and other IDE-like features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the code review page THEN the system SHALL display a Monaco editor with syntax highlighting
2. WHEN a user selects a programming language THEN the Monaco editor SHALL switch to the appropriate language mode with proper syntax highlighting
3. WHEN a user types code in the editor THEN the system SHALL provide auto-completion suggestions and error detection
4. WHEN a user pastes code into the editor THEN the system SHALL maintain proper formatting and indentation
5. IF the code contains syntax errors THEN the Monaco editor SHALL highlight the errors with appropriate indicators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to communicate with the backend API endpoints, so that I can submit code for analysis and receive review results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Review Code" button THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to the backend analysis endpoint
2. WHEN the backend returns analysis results THEN the frontend SHALL display the review feedback in a structured format
3. IF the API request fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user
4. WHEN submitting code for review THEN the system SHALL show a loading state during the API call
5. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL update the UI with the results without requiring a page refresh

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper routing between different pages of the application, so that I can navigate seamlessly and bookmark specific pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to different routes THEN the system SHALL update the URL and display the correct page component
2. WHEN a user refreshes the page on any route THEN the system SHALL maintain the current page state
3. WHEN a user uses browser back/forward buttons THEN the system SHALL navigate correctly between pages
4. IF a user accesses an invalid route THEN the system SHALL display a 404 error page or redirect to home
5. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL update the active navigation state in the UI

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upload code files directly to the editor, so that I can review existing code files without manual copy-pasting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects the "Upload File" tab THEN the system SHALL display a file upload interface
2. WHEN a user uploads a supported code file THEN the system SHALL load the file content into the Monaco editor
3. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and set the appropriate programming language
4. IF an unsupported file type is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display an error message
5. WHEN a large file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL handle it gracefully without freezing the UI

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see detailed review results with code suggestions, so that I can understand and implement the recommended improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis results are received THEN the system SHALL display issues categorized by severity (error, warning, suggestion)
2. WHEN a review issue is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the line number, description, and suggested fix
3. WHEN a user clicks on a review issue THEN the system SHALL highlight the corresponding code in the Monaco editor
4. WHEN multiple issues exist THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and sorting options
5. IF no issues are found THEN the system SHALL display a positive confirmation message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to handle authentication state properly, so that I can access protected features and maintain my session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page for protected routes
2. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL store the authentication token and redirect to the intended page
3. WHEN an authentication token expires THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to log in again
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear the authentication state and redirect to the login page
5. IF an API request returns 401 unauthorized THEN the system SHALL handle it by redirecting to login

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want responsive design across different screen sizes, so that I can use the application on various devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is viewed on mobile devices THEN the Monaco editor SHALL be properly sized and usable
2. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the layout SHALL adapt responsively without breaking functionality
3. WHEN using touch devices THEN the editor SHALL support touch interactions for scrolling and selection
4. IF the screen is too small for optimal editing THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate UI adjustments
5. WHEN switching between portrait and landscape THEN the layout SHALL adjust accordingly
